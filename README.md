GIS & Cartography Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) projects, including cartographic design, spatial analysis, and web-based mapping applications.

The work presented here reflects academic coursework and applied GIS experience, focusing on spatial problem-solving, clear geographic communication, and real-world mapping workflows.

Projects include static maps, analytical reports, and interactive web applications developed using industry-standard GIS platforms.

Areas of Focus

Cartographic design & visual communication

Thematic mapping & spatial analysis

Infrastructure and campus-based GIS

Remote sensing & imagery-based projects

Web maps & dashboards

Purpose

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to:

Transform geographic data into meaningful spatial products

Apply analytical GIS workflows

Design clean, readable, and effective maps

Communicate spatial information clearly through both static and interactive formats
